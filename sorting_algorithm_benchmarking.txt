This project would have 5 sorting algorithms operating on a fixed dataset. Each of them would be timed to find out the performance. 


O(nk) in the worst case algorithms:
1. Radix Sort (done)

O(n^2) in the worst case algorithms:
2. Bubble Sort (done)
3. Selection Sort (done)

O(n log(n)) in the worst case algorithms:
4. Merge Sort (in progress...)
